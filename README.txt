# CryoApp

|=============================================================================|

Application developed for the CPOM group during my placement at University of Leeds in summer 2016.

|=============================================================================|

- The application is built using the Ionic Framework, based on the ngCordova platform. To develop the application further, the development environment will need to have Node.js, Cordova and Ionic CLI's installed (http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/)

- Installation and updating of the included plugins requires that both 'npm' and 'bower' are also installed on the development environment. Documentation for common errors can be found on the Ionic Forums. (https://forum.ionicframework.com/)

- Ionic uses HTML, JavaScript, CSS and SASS, using the AngularJS framework. It can be easily previewed on a browser when being hosted on a local server, but building the app for Android requires the Android SDK and a Java IDE (https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html), and building for iOS requires a Mac and Xcode (https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). Some of the plugins included in the application only work on mobile devices, and so will throw errors when viewed on a browser, but not when run natively.

- If the code needs to be updated by a new user, feel free to commit any changes and submit a pull request, I'll be maintaining the repository.
