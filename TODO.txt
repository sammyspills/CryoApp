TODO:

|================================================================================|
  Application code:
  
- Set GPS timeout to 1 hour, set debug=false
- Populate "Download" screen with list from $http request, once server is set up

|================================================================================|
  Outside Application:
  
- Backend sever setup:
  - Hosting of new/additional server holding application scripts
  - Have folder containing latest sea-ice data in *.csv format with one header line of column names: "lat,lon,thick"
  - Have script/folder to automatically generate segment means for the Sea Ice visualisation in app. File should be a *.csv with one header line of column names: "season,date,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20"
    Each number corresponds to the mean of the respective segment (detailed below). Season corresponds to the name of the data (e.g "Spring 2012"). Date corresponds to a date-object string (%Y-%d-%m) of the date of the data (e.g "2012-01-04").
  - Have script to process incoming user routes. Possibly a SQL Database (Research for this hasn't been done yet). Hold a user route, process the route against the sea ice data when a new user route is received, push the processed result to the user.
  
- Application Publishing:
  - Create CPOM Developer accounts for Apple and Google stores.
  - Test on iOS device.
  - Create signed build for both platforms and submit for review (Creating builds: 1wk, Review: up to 2months).
  - Receive review feedback (Can't see a reason for it not being accepted. Stores will provide feedback if not accepted)
  - After acceptance, publish to both stores.
